<h1><h1><a href="index.html">Seattle Vert Ramp</a>: Schedule</h1>

The goal is to have the ramp built and ready to skate as soon as possible.  The more people who volunteer to help, the faster this will happen!  If you're interested in helping, email <a href="mailto:wstein@gmail.com">wstein@gmail.com</a> (or message <a href="http://www.facebook.com/william.stein.37">William Stein on facebook</a>) for more information.   Also, join the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/345733795438475/">Seattle Vertramp Facebook page</a>. 

<br><br>This schedule could be significantly set back if: (1) the ClearSpan building doesn't ship on time, or (2) it starts raining.
