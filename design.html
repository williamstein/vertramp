<p>The ramp will be 13.5' tall with 2 feet over vert.  It will have 14' of flat bottom,
and at least 8' side decks on both sides.  It will be covered by a ClearSpan HD tension fabric building. 

<p>The transition sections are 8' wide framed with 2x6 with independent
templates. This will allow the ramp to be assembled and dissembled in
sections.  This is consistent with how virtually all modern vert ramps
are built.

<p>The Framing is 8" on center on the transitions. 1' OC on the flat
and 16" OC on the decks. Framing is doubled up at 4' increments to
accommodate solid plywood seams. Decks are framed with 2x8.

<p>The ramp transitions are layered with one layer of 3/8 CDX ply and
one layer of AB ply. The top layer of AB ply is sanded and free of
voids. It is also a denser higher quality ply that adds strength and
quality. This also means that we don't have to fill voids in order to
prevent soft spots. We had discussed a third layer of 3/8 when we were
going with Masonite but eliminated that layer when we decided to go
with the 3/8 birch layed diagonally. This ramp will not be slippery.

<p>The two layers of 3/8 also lets us use one layer of 3/4 for the
flat. This saves time on the build. The 3/4 ply is a solid cross band
ply. It is a high grade engineered product designed for structural
flooring underlayment. It is sanded and has no voids on the internal
plys. This will also be used for the decks and templates.

<p>We discussed 1/2" briefly and the consensus was that the two layers
of 3/8 will be more than adequate especially with the layer of AB and
the 3/8 birch.

<p>We have a team that will work well together and deliver a world
class ramp. Lots of experience here. We have not cut corners and have
selected high quality materials. All framing is Doug Fir and the ply
is high quality. No budget lumber. High quality wood makes a huge
difference!
